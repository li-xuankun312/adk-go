// withICDelta applies d to the invocation this context speaks for, and refuses a

//
// Nothing in this repository returns nil from WithICDelta. The guard is for
// implementations written outside it, which the exported interface allows and
// which cannot be enumerated — and which reach the shape easily, because a
// decorator that embeds InvocationContext has to override WithICDelta or lose
// itself on the first delta.
//
// Storing that nil leaves a commonContext whose invocation is gone, and most of
// its accessors — Agent, Branch, Session, UserID among them — dereference it.
// Where that panic surfaces depends on the node: a plain workflow node
// dereferences the invocation inside startNodeSpan, which runNode calls before
// installing its recover, so the process dies. A node that emits its own span
// gets a noop span and an untouched context, so the panic happens inside Run
// and is recovered as "node %q panicked".
//
// Keeping the previous invocation is the better of the two, but it is not free:
// the delta is gone, so the caller runs on with the previous Agent, Branch and
// IsolationScope. Nothing else distinguishes that from the delta having been
// applied, so it is reported. An agent running under the wrong parent is not a
// quiet kind of wrong.
//
// It does NOT try to detect the larger problem, which is that an
// InvocationContext written outside the module inherits WithICDelta by
// promotion, so the promoted method hands back the invocation it embeds and the
// decorator — with the session naming its own user — is dropped. Two attempts to
// catch that from here were measured and both were worse than the disease. Keying
// on "is the receiver one of ours" refuses the delta for an in-module test double
// that implements WithICDelta perfectly well. Keying on "did a value that could
// not answer for itself turn into one that can" misses a decorator whose parent
// is also from outside the module, and where it does fire it discards the whole
// delta — so agent.Run then reads Agent, Branch and IsolationScope from the
// enclosing invocation, or nil-panics when there is no enclosing agent.
//
// The defect is in the decorator contract, not here: a type that cannot override
// WithICDelta cannot survive a delta, and no amount of inspection at this call
// site reconstructs what it should have returned. It predates the identity key
// and is documented on IdentityFromContext instead.
//
// It also hands every sibling derivation the same invocation object, where the
// working path gives each one a copy. That is the one cost a reader cannot
// recover by inspecting a value: EndInvocation on any child now ends the parent
// and its siblings, and the write races their Ended. #1135 makes that
// propagation deliberate and synchronises the flag, and until it lands this
// branch has the sharing without either.

	// A delta with nothing to say about the invocation must not cost an
	// invocation from outside the module its identity. A promoted WithICDelta
	// hands back the invocation the decorator embeds whatever the delta says, so
	// merely asking is what drops the decorator — and entering a workflow does
	// exactly that, with a CommonContextDelta carrying no InvocationContextDelta
	// at all (workflow.go sets Path, RunID, OutputForAncestors and SubScheduler).
	//
	// "Nothing to say" is emptiness, not a nil pointer. A caller that allocates
	// the delta and then fills it conditionally hands over an empty one whenever
	// no condition fires, and keying on nil alone made that one-token neighbour
	// drop the decorator where the nil case did not.
	//
	// Ours are still asked, because for them an empty delta is not a no-op: the
	// tool and callback wrappers forward to the commonContext they hold, which
	// returns that inner context, and skipping the call would leave the wrapper
	// in place with the nil session it reports by design. That is the same reason
	// the report below forwards a nil d rather than short-circuiting on it.
	//
	// What it costs, which is not nothing. An invocation from outside the module
	// that is ALSO a session-less forwarding view — the shape tool_context_wrapper
	// has, written out there instead of in here — is kept rather than unwrapped,
	// so the session it does not have is the one the caller gets, and UserID
	// nil-panics on it. That is a real regression against forwarding through, and
	// it is accepted because the two shapes cannot be told apart here: measured,
	// a forwarding view and a decorator whose own session is nil are both "not
	// ours, session unreadable" before the call, and diverge only after it, into
	// the right user and the enclosing one respectively. Preferring the call
	// rescues the first and hands the second a live user who made no such call.
	// So an out-of-module InvocationContext must carry its own session.
	//
	// It also hands back the invocation itself rather than whatever the call would
	// have produced, and that is true of BOTH shapes of zero delta — nil and
	// allocated-but-empty. Out-of-module invocations are the only population this
	// reaches, and for them both cases changed: without the shortcut each is passed
	// through, so a forwarding view is unwrapped and a decorator is dropped onto
	// what it embeds; with it, each is kept. Two dimensions move together, which
	// object comes back and whether the decorator survives, and the second is why
	// the trade is worth making.
	//
	// One consequence of keeping the object: EndInvocation on a context derived
	// this way reaches the invocation it was derived from, where an ADK-owned
	// invocation handed an empty non-nil delta gets a copy instead, because
	// agent.go's WithICDelta allocates once any delta is present.
